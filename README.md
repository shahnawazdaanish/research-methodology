4. We want to compare the performance of four test generation algorithms named ALG1 to ALG4. In this task we focus in this question

What algorithm produces test suits faster (time to generate a complete test suite)?
To answer this question we have run each algorithm 30 times and collected performance data as describe in the moodle page "Description of the experiment and collected data".

Note that  to know the time used to generate a test suite, we should add the time needed to generate each individual test in the test suite (there are 500 tests per test suite, 30 test suite per algorithm).

You task is to create a Jupyter notebook that contains the necessary calculations, plots and explanations in English, including

  A) relevant descriptive statistics for the test suite generation time variable, including sample mean, median, standard deviation, min, max.
  B) create a histogram and a boxplot for each algorithm
When creating your Jupyter notebook make sure that you include:

python code and the execution results (including plots).
explanations in English to understand the code and the results.
axis labels and legend in each plot. Include units when suitable.
